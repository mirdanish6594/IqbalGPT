English Translation: Gul colors
You are not difficult to find out
O Gul Colors, may not be heartbroken
The adornment is a concert, not a co -insurgent concert
This graduation entity I do not get
In this chaman, I wish for a curse
And your life -threatening desires
Breaking up from the branch you do not die
This look does not look like a look
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
How do I explain to you that I do not go?
Work to me with the confusion of the devotees
I do with a bubble
Silence on hundred languages ​​is also approved by you
The secret is what is in the chest that is mast
My case is also a Berg of Riyadh
I am far from the chaman, you are also away from the chaman
You are confused, I am worried about the smell
I live in the wounded Shamsher
This problem should not be a collective goods
This liver lamp should not be wisdom
Inadequate will not be the power of the Murray
Do not be surprised by the Constitution
This search is the case where the Afroz is
Toussan is a source

It was bright with a tribulation on the thought
The rooster is accessible to the rooster
There was a curse soul
Zeba was also a concert, there was also a concert
Did your eye is approved by this beauty
Bin's swollen life in everything that is adorned
The concert is from the capital
Just like the songs of the rivers
Your paradise is the spring of nature
The world grows from the worry of the world
Life is a matter of writing
In the photo of the lip in the picture
The narcissists are 100 on your lips
Surprisingly, Sarai is on the flight
The witnesses are in the best way
The lining is on the shiraz
Ahh you are comfortable in the heartbeat
Gulatin Wimmer* I am your dream
Your neighbor is not possible in the pleasure
Not as much as possible unless the worry is perfect
Hi what happened now
Ah, O look of the look at the point of view
Gesu Urdu
The candle is a bargain
O Jahanabad
There are curses
The particles are dreaming in the particles
Thus are hidden in your dust millions deep
Is there any pride in burial?
Is there any pearls in you?

English Translation: A spider and a bee
One day a bees said to the spider
This path happens on the passage of your day
But never wake up to Murree Katia
You never put your foot here
There is nothing to meet with strangers
But do not stretch your own
Come on, who is honored in my house
He is in front of the ladder that is approved
The bee heard the listener who spoke the spider
Hazrat will give it to an ignorant
In this trap the bees never come
Who climbed on your ladder, then did not come down
The spider said Wow Freebie understand me
You will be in no foolish era
Approved you for the sake of me
Some of the benefits did not die in it
Where is God going?
Wait what is in the house of Murray
There are many things to show you in this house
The outside looks the little ones.
The curtains are fine on the hanging doors
The walls are from the mirror I decorated
The guests are present to the calf
Not every person has this mauser
Facian said, "That's all right but
I come to your house, don't keep it
God save me from these soft scorpions
Sleeping, no one can get up again
The spider said, "In the heart, listen to it
How is it less fortunate to hang it
100 works out of flattery where I
Look at which the world is of flattery
He said to the bees of thought.
Allah has forgiven you.
It is your love for you
Be the one who ever looked at you
The eyes are the shining kin of the diamond
Sir, your God decorated with a kalghi
This beauty, this garment, this good, this cleaning
Then there is the resurrection on it.
The bee heard when it was flattened
Bid no no me from me
I understand the habit of denial
The truth is that it is not good to break the heart
Say this and Ori from his place
When he approached, the spider jumped and caught it
I was hungry for several days, now the hand that came
Comfortably blowing the bees sitting at home

English Translation: A mountain and squirrel
For children
Any mountain used to say it from a squirrel
If you are ashamed, go into the water and die
The slightest thing is, what to say, what to say
This intellect and understanding it, this consciousness, what to say
God is the glory of God.
Those who are unconscious become like this
What is the backbone of my glory?
The earth is ahead of the low -mary on Ban
What is in me, where are you?
Good mountain where, animals poor
He said, "The squirrel of this Sun, just handled the mouth
These are the things that are out of the heart
What I don't do is like you?
You are not even small like Murray
Everything created from something is the power of God
No big, no little, this is his wisdom
He made you in the big world
He taught me to climb the tree
The power to step is not just in you
The light is great, good and what about you
If you are older, you look like me
This bark was just broken by me
Not the thing is Nakami in a time
No evil in the factory of the power

English Translation: For children
A pasture was green somewhere
There was a curse spring whose land
Does this spring be all about
There were clean rivers on all sides
Were pomegranated trees of pomegranates
And the shade tree of the Pepal
Cold cool winds came
The tires came to the centuries
A goat with a river
The sticks came from somewhere
When I stayed and looked around
Found a cow standing up
He bowed first and greeted him
Then spoke in such a way that
Why are the big b moods?
The cows bid that good are good
Cutting evil good
Is life in trouble
John has come on, what to say
What is bad, what to say
I see the glory of God
I am crying for the soul of evil
Strong not the poor of the poor
The appearance of the fortunes
Nobody do good to the man
Fare it, God not
If the milk is less, it grows
Yes, the legend of the legend is eaten
Slave with tactics
What is ram
I nurture her children
I know the milk
This is the evil of goodness
My God is the same
The goat of the Sun
Say, don't be good
The thing is true
I would say but God seems
This pasture, it was cool
This green grass and this shadow
Where is such a pleasure to us?
Where, where the poor poor
These are from the tail of the fun guy
All the pleasures are from the end of this
It is from its tail
Imprisoned us that freedom
The hundred is in the bangs
God saved from the passing passage
We are grateful to him.
We do not go to Ziba
Understand the value if rest
Never hug a man
Listen to the cows and shy
Regrets from the man's throat
He was evil in his heart
And he said something
Thus, the caste is a goat
The heart seems to be a goat

Wearing Zamdar's clothes
The burning in the hands of everyone
They were quiet
God had to go? Where
It was in the same way that my passenger
I came to this congregation
He was behind and did not walk fast
Dia did not burn in his hands
He said, "I know, my go
Where did you leave me?
I live in separation
I am the loser of the gests every day
Don't care for us
Leave, good faith you did
The child who saw the patchy patchy

Crying is the separation of you
No no good in it

Then he saw it and said
Do you think you have done it?

Are you unfortunate I am craving the house?
The companions are in the homeland, I am in prison
Eye spring, the buds are laughing
I'm crying luck in this dark house
Who should hear the divine suffering of this imprisonment
I am afraid that I do not die of grief in the coffee
Ever since the chaman has been left out, it has happened
The heart is eating grief, sorrow is eating
The song is not happy to understand it
This is the cry of suffering hearts
Free to me, and imprisoned
I am helpless, so take a prayer and pray

Doing on the magic of heaven
The look of the night is on the awakening
The divers river is in silence
Yes, but from a distance the sound of the sound
The heart is that of the world in the abnormalism
Draw me away from the riot universal
I am a spectator of the scene
We are lonely loneliness
Let me sit in the heart of the heart
And let me down four tears on this town
Where do you live in the head of negligence?
Say something the end of that country, where you live
He is also surprised and is a person?
And is there a spectacle of the elements?
The man is also in grief.
In this province too, did he force him?
Well, what does it burn on the swelling candle?
What is the fiction in this chaman too?
Or if a chorus goes out of the heart
What does the heat of the poem even melt?
Relationships are the victim of life
Are there such nasalities in this gullast?
This is where I am an economy and 100
Is the soul free from this thought in this country?
Is there electricity, there is also a dilemma, even Khurman?
Are there even caravans, worrying?
Do you choose from there for Ashas?
What is the worry about the gallbladder?
Well, are they alienated from their realities?
What are the madness of the discrimination?
Even do not cry on the bubble?
There is no pain like this?
Is the garden or a destination comfort?
Or is it the name of the Beneficent Beauty?
Is Hell is a synthesis of infidelity?
Is there a purpose in the flames of fire?
Is it flying in this country of speed?
Death is called the people of the land, what is the secret?
Anxiety is the heart of the heart
What is limited in this province?
Does the heart be satisfied with the heart of the heart?
Are you saying 'Lin Tarani' or even there?
Is it in the pursuit of the soul to rest there?
Is it there too?
Ah, what is it in the dark?
Or is it a light of love?
You tell the secrets that are in this dome
Death is in the heart of the heart

Wisdom said one day with a heart
I am the leader of the forgotten stray
I am on the ground, died on the flick
See how much I am I
Work is guidance in the world
For example, I am a khazar
I am the book of the book.
I am the shrine of Kabriya
The drop is a blood but you
I am an awesome
The heart heard it and said this is all true
But see me too, what am I
You understand the secret entity
And with eyes I look
Is from you to the phenomena
And I am acquainted with the inner
Knowledge from you through me
You are God, I am a blessing
The extreme of knowledge is the indifference
But I am the medicine for this disease
The candle is the righteousness of the game
I am the best of beauty
You have a relationship with the time.
I am a Sadra acquaintance

I am burning tomorrow no one aspects me
Yes, Oh, Oh, Ganga, I
The land is hypocritical of his resurrection
How is the attachment, or is it a prohibition
This is an unfamiliarity of a color in return
The same khurman's grains are divided
Whose flowers do not come to the air
There is no fun song in this chaman
I am erased on the real
I panic from the coast and the coast
Dancing is the poet of the poet
If not Khurman, then where is the grain?
What is the beauty of yourself when there is no inclination
What does it mean by the burning of the candle that does not happen
Why not change the taste of silence
Why don't this essence come out of my mirror
When opened the tongue, our delightful conversation
The chaman was burned when the chaman was on fire

English Translation: Candle
Bazm where I am also a candle
Freed up
The love of the heat is to you
And the ghost of the shapes of the shaft
The candle is the luxury that the candle shrine you
Everywhere you have been saddened
One of your eyesight is the secret of the lovers
My eyesight Mai Ashba
In the Ka'bah, the idol is in the uniform
I was trapped in the Haram
There is a shan ah in the black
Is there a hidden heart in the third place?
It is burning that the electrical is far from the essence
Understand your swelling that is light
You are burning and you don't know anything
Bina and do not look at the swelling
I am also anxiously anxious
Awareness of the heart of the heart is also disobedient
It was also a nazi of a naze
Gave me the feeling
This awareness of this awareness keeps me
Dreams are in this evil
This discrimination is from this
The aroma in the gul, the fun in the wine is the same
It is aware of this
The origin is the mind
In the morning, the beauty of the day
The sound of 'kun'
It was a command to see the spring of Gulshani
Look at the dream of taking one eye
Don't ask me the news of the hijab
The evening was the morning
Those days were that I was not familiar with imprisonment
The zeal of the tree was a worshiped
Am a prisoner and I know the chaman i
I know the grief of poverty I know
The memory of the memory became unprecedented
Hobbies, sometimes, sometimes a taste
O candles, look at the utmost deception
Look at the foundation of Sakinan Flick
I am a fray, I am a bit
Who am I and I am
Tie me what he wanted me
Written by Diwan
Gohar likes to be in a shared dust
Although the closure is slow, the subjects are high
This is the whole fault of the tragedy
The universe is the conscious consciousness
This series is of time and time,
The shackles are like the beauty of the spectacle
The destination is the appetite, the lost path
O candles, I am a captive
You, the throat of the throat too
Bam Haram, too, you are also a harem
I am beautiful that I am a loved one
Don't open that I am Nazi or Niaz
Yes, the acquaintance is not the secret.
Then do not leave the story

English Translation: A wish
I am tired of the world's concerts or the Lord
Is the luxurious association when the heart is over
I run away from the insurgency, find the heart my
A script on which the speech is also
I die on the silence, it is my desire
Be a small hut of the elbow in the foot
Be free worry, spend the day in honor
The heart of the world has gone out of the heart
In the birds of the delicious anthem
The springs of the springs are ringing
The message of the gall is a message to someone
Sagar just a little bit
Hold on hand, be a vegetable
Shame on which they are paid in solitude
Monos is so bad
The little one in his heart does not die in his heart
The array is green green on both sides
Taking a photo of the river's clean water
Ho the scene of such a look
Water also becomes a wave, you get up
In Aghosh, the sole of the earth is a vegetable
The water is shining in the shrubs then
Touching the water
Like Hussein see a mirror
The henna is the sun when the sun is on the evening
For the headlines, the golden opinion of each floor
Keep walking at night. Tired of tired
Hopefully they have been my broken
Show them Katia Murray with lightning brightness
When every hundred clouds are surrounded by heaven
The coil of the previous afternoon, the mornings of the morning
I am his newborn, he is my nephew
Be on the ears, not my deeds
The day is the hut of me
Come to the flowers that will perform wudoo '
Crying is wudoo ', Nala Murree Prayer
Go to this quiet
Be the caravan of wire
Let every painful heart cry
The unconscious who are lying, maybe they wake them up
Sunrise
If the insurgency is beyond this
The adornment is a flicker from which he is a sagor
If the morning is the morning, he is a guru
The one on whom the seed is nazi is jewelry
From the page to the night, the night of the night
Cucumber like a vanity from heaven
Beauty when you fall from the balm
Eye flies the effect of a dream wine
The light gets filled
Opens the springs of appearance.
Looking for which the eyes should be a spectacle
The springs from which the opening of the fountain should be burned
Do not get out in the world of hobbies
For a lifetime imprisoned chain
The underworld is one for your eyes
I wish I had something like this spectacle
Eye is settled in my grief and grief
The heart is free from the discrimination
Do not be a specialty color
The people of the nation are my homeland, my homeland
The secret to the inner self is the power of the inner self
Ho the smoke of the flickering candle
Do not try to try to get me
I see everything in love with me
If the trauma is traumatized
Being Ashk to be dripping from my eyes
In the heart, that little evil of love
From the light whose secrets of truth
Be the mirror of the witness, the heart should not be mine
There is no deal in the head, there is no deal
If you are not a disturbing scholar
This is not a virtue of virtue
From your beauty that you are not mournful
Communication is not a particle of dust
The light of the light was a hot spectacle
And you remained in the morning
The desire is in our heart of the light
The house of Leila is in this regard
What a pleasure in difficulty
The pleasure is in our earnestness
Not familiar with the use of pain
Not knowing the secrets of God

No doubt I will not be able to do so
This is a far -reaching point, sitting somewhere hiding
In the heart you have, sit in secret
Neglect is a surprise to you
Joya not looks at the nourishment
Let it be as if I have a loud idea
Leaving in surprise to the wisdom

Not this association of the trumpet.
This is an association.
Purpose of the sight of the sight
Each heart is worse than the thought of wine
Something and nowadays the clam of clams

Do not tease these fans on the colors that do not come now

The boldness is the rod of politics
Do not hesitate to hesitate
Well, if you do, what do you care about
The believer's heart is free from beams
The strength is stupid in front of the practice
Be if the raw miracles of your hands in the hands
Glass heart if your example is jammed
Keeping pure, your tongue is merciful, you are merciful
Do not be seen
Wake up to the goldsmiths from the honor of the poem
The burning of falsehood with a loud voice

English Translation: Humans and Bazm
In the morning, I saw the Khurshid Durkhashan
I asked for this
The light is from the tail of the seal
Sami is the water of the rivers
Maher has worn the light of light
The same candle is shining to your gamers
There are pictures of the Gul and Gulzar
These are the interpretations of the Surrea 'Valmas'
The red dress is the flowers, the green of the trees
No green, no red fairy in your concert
The tents of the tents are a jerk
Changes come red
What does it look good
In the evening of the wine
The rank is your bigger, great
Everything is in the light of the light
In the morning a song is cursed
Not even under the influence of cruelty
I am also settled in this light of light but
Burned, then how Akhtar of Murree Destiny?
I am far from the light I am arrested
Why am I, Siyyh, Bakht, Siyar?
I used to say that the voice came from somewhere
The balm came from the kidneys or from the courtyard
The light is associated with the light
The gardener is the third entity.
The association is the beauty of you, I am a picture
Love is the scripture, I am the commentary
You made my corrupt tasks
You did not wake up from me.
Noor Khurshid is in need
And the dishonest is shining
If you are not Khurshid
The name of the destination is the name of my life
Ah, O my secrets of the secret
Throne of the throat in the throat
Hi neglect that your eye is obliged
Nazi Ziba was you, you are, but hot niaz
If you are aware of your reality
Do not stay on the day, then do not stay in the day

Wagaya Billball Colors in Asian
Shake along the edge of the field.
The cruelty of the night was broken by the sunrise
The crown was blown in the dark
Read the tragedy of the dreams
The message to Brahmin
Come to the Haram Haram as if to
Not even the heart of the heart?
Pagan stood on the wall of the wall like this
You are the gullast of the gullasts and the gallows
Give this command in the desert
The shining is about every particle of Jagno Bin
Sleep the poor when the living town of the living
So seeing this dialect, the city's silence
Lie up comfortably now, I will still come
Where will you, to dream, you will wake up

English Translation: Love and death
Shani appearance where the clock was
Tabsim was the key to life
Somewhere the seal was getting crown
Atta Moon was getting moonlight
Sayyah was giving the evening
The stars had an education
Somewhere the branch was the leaf
Somewhere in life was the burst of life
The angels used to teach Shabnam
Laughing was the first of the first
Atta was painful to the poet's heart
The self -sufficiency was anxiety
Get up first of the first lower black
There was no hovering peak open
The land was claimed that I was heaven
Mecca was saying that I am La Mecca
Gentle it was this scenario cute
That the looks are curse
Malik tested the flight his
The light from the jabinis
The angel was a single, love name
That was the guidance of all his support
The angel that was a pantry
The country of the country and the mercury
Pi Sir was going to Firdous
In the way of qada, it is the case
What is the name of this ask, what is the work
No, the eye
Hua Sun as if the angel of qada
Am ajal, my job is Ashkara
Let me fly
I am about to do my life
Murray has a magic nest in the eye
The prophet is annihilated
But there is an entity in the world
It is a fire in front of him
Shirr Bin lives in the heart of Anas
He is the star of the eyes of the absolute
Tears of Ben Ben from the Eyes
They are the tears whose bitterness
Sunni love converses when it comes to qada
Laughing on her lips
Gree on the light of this Tabasam
What did you spend in the darkness of the dark
The survival that was seen
It was qada ', the victim was qada

English Translation: Zahid and Randi
I listen to a Maulvi sir
Not accelerating the approved nature
The shahra was very much of your philosophical
He used to do literature
They used to say that there is a law in Sufism
The way that words are essential
Liberiz wine was from Zahid
There was a lot of thought in the eyes
Used to do you your miracles
The number was approved
I was released from time to neighbor
Zahid meeting with Tha Rind
Hazrat asked a acquaintance
Iqbal, that is the meaning of Shamshad.
How is the ban in the law?
Even though the poem is in the poem
I hear that the disbelievers do not understand the Hindu
Such a belief is that philosophy
There is a slight in its nature
We listen to it
It is understood that the chord entered the worship
The purpose is the religion but the dust
Some Araw
It is the habit of our poem
The song that is the night is to recite the sunrise
The meaning of these rituals has not opened so far.
But this is from my males I have heard
Like his young
The collection is the same, Iqbal is not
Heart is the office of wisdom, the nature of nature
Also aware of Randi, familiar with the Shariah
Ask the Sufism, the secondary of Mansoor
This person does not open the truth to us
It will be the founder of any other Islam
Al -Qa'a gave a lot of prolonged sermons
It has been a long time
What happens in this city, in all
I also listen to my oral
One day that the path of Hazrat Zahid
Then the same thing is old
He said, "The complaint was because of love
The duty was to see the path of the Shariah
I said that no one is me
It was your right
The source is acknowledged in front of you
Perry is due to my youth
Fall you don't know my reality
Not born to some of the culprits
I not even myself knowing my reality
The deepest water of the ocean ideas
I also want to see 'Iqbal'
A lot of Ashki in his separation
Iqbal is also not aware of 'Iqbal'
Something is not ridiculed, is not wow

Holiday O Bazm where I go home to sleep
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I am a sad heart, not a concerted party
You are not able to die, I am not able
In prison, the court of the court and the Shabestan
The chain of gold will break out
Although the great pleasure is in the riot
Student but in your acquaintance
We have been companionship with your own eyes for a long time
The long -awaited waves remained in the ocean
In the ups and downs, I am sitting
I kept on shouting light in cruelty
Looking for a long time
Ah, he did not come to Joseph in the market
Looking for the springs now and the look
The desire is the beach my storm hit
Like you leave, I go to your face
Holiday O Bazm where I go home to sleep
The house is built in the silence
Ah, where in the music of music
We are Nargis Shahala, Companion
Is my homeland, my neighbor bubbles
In the evening the sound of the springs sounds me
In the morning the floor wakes me from the green
In the Bazamites, everyone likes the gamers
The heart is the poet but the loneliness of the loneliness
I have to panic me in the population
Who do I find in the Valley of Koh?
Whose hobby does the vegetation of me?
And makes me on the edges of the springs?
It is a joke that you are a shadow
Look, O negligent, I am a pious.
Of our homeland, I am a secret of the country
I am the sound of this chaman's quiet
Something I hear to listen to others
I see something to show others
Lover, I am heartbroken, I am in my house
I am in the midst of the seat and Alexander
Latina is under the influence of magic
Look at the stars in the evening
The surprise of the scholar is where it appears
The secret is visible in the gall

Where is the ball, where is the cloak of sugar?
That a little animal is broken
Your mirror was a free balloon
As soon as the eye is opened
In the hands of the hand, hidden in the style
Your appearance is also your newborn

Your eyes are on your eyes, but the secret of God

English Translation: Bilal
The shining of the star was the sacred
He lifted you from the Ethiopian and brought it to Hijaz
The population of the grief is more than that
Thousands of freedom of slavery
He did not leave the Asta for a moment
In someone's hobby you have fun
Jaffa, which is in love
If not hurt, there is nothing fun in love
The look was in the case of Salma
Wine was growing and thirsty
You had a look like a look at the scene
Owais was a powers of power
Medina was the light of your eyes as if
So this desert was as if
The look at your eyes is also a sensation
The best thing to do is the new side of the asthma
Gree he is on the brink of a soul
That was the brutal cruelty on Moses
The flames of the heat of the heat
If you get the lightning out of the way
The pay was a curse niaz
Keep watching someone was prayer
From the beginning, the anthem of love became the anthem
Prayer became an excuse for his view
Happy that was the time when it was a place
Happy he was far away

English Translation: History Adam
Listen to me of my poverty
I forgot the story of the first
I do not see my nature in Paradise
When I felt the fiery
There is the reality of the universe to me
I shown the idea of ​​a flicker
Something like this
I did not say that I did not know
Extracted from the Ka'bah to the statue of the stone
Ever made idols I have a harem
I ever reached the taste
I hid the light
Ever the cross on the cross
The journey to Kaya Flick, leaving the earth
Sometimes I was hiding in the cave for years
Given where I ever jammed
Come to India, the Lord of the Rabbani
Likes ever the head of the Jonah
The Diyar -i -India did not listen
Betherah letter in Japan and the country
The synthesis made of particles sometimes the scholar
I have given the meaning of education against me
What hundreds of lands
Where I wise to tease
I did not understand the fact when the stars
Spend the night in the same idea that I
Don't be able to scare the church to me
I taught the problem of circulation
The secret of attractive
I am iconic wit.
What a prisoner, the lightning
Heavenly Paradise I made this land
But the news is not a secret entity
From the microscope where I was niggled
Hoo that the fountains of the fountains are finally
So I found it in my heart

Jagno's light is in Kashanۀ Chaman
Or the candle is burning in the association of flowers
There is a star flying from heaven
Or is it known in the ray of Mehtab
Or the ambassador of the day came to the kingdom of the night
The brightness of poverty, was anonymous in the homeland
The pillow has dropped
Is particle or in the palm of the prominent sun
It was a hidden glimpse of the ancient
Brought to which the Almighty in the association
In the small moon, cruelty is also light
NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER, NEVER
Prana a kite, Jagno also a kite
That student of light, this light curse
Everything where I power gave up
He was shocked, lighting the jagno
The colors were made to the nephew
Education by giving language to the gul
The goodness of the ideology was in the fall
Gave this fairy a little life of shining
The colors of the sun, the shadow of the banker
The red pair of wear shabnam's RCD
Shadowed the shazar, to the flight given
Give the water flowing, the waves gave
This is a distinction but one thing is ours
Jagno's day is the same as the night
The beauty of beauty is a glimpse of everything
In this, she's the sarcas
This moon is the heart of the poet's heaven as if
The vowel is the moonlight that is the whiskey of something, or the pain of the pain
The style of conversation has cheated or else
The song is a bubble, the smell of a flower
The secret of unity has become hidden in the abundance
The shine in the jagno is the aroma in the flower
Why this disagreement then the palace of riots
In everything, while the silence is in silence

English Translation: The star of the morning
Leave the neighbors and the losers
And leave this service message
In my favor, the town of wires is good
Good luck from this height
What is the sky, the homeland is mine
The morning is a shroud shroud
My fate is in everyday death
Drinking a sibling with the hands of a scandalous death
Neither this service, nor this honor, nor is it good
The brutality of this watch is good
What was in my power would not have been a worst
The shining shining in the river of the river
Even the waves of the waves that panic
Leaving the Sea somewhere
Is becoming a jewelry jewelry in shining
Zenith Crown Sir Caesar
Of a stone that wakes up to the piece
The end of the end of the Salimah continued to become
Such pimpies but in the dehydration
Is the end of the Grand Fine
Life is the one who does not know
Is it that living in which the requirement is that
This is the end if you become adornment
Why not fall on a flower
Live in the stars of a forehead
Who should I live in the evil of the oppressed
Become an ash
Why not drop from his wife's eyes
For
Whose husband is living in the jewelry
So, the field is forced by the homeland, the homeland
The view of Yas and hope that looks
Whose silence is also ashamed of the speech
To whom the husband's pleasure gives Shakibi
And give the eyes the strength to the eyes
Yellow, leave clock, disorder
The beauty of the beauty should be enriched
Millions of she seize but I just go to the dripping
Let's go from the Sagar -e -Did
Let me find eternal life in the dust
Let's show the swelling of love

The fountains are in the concert so far
Today but all the chameleon is in mourning
The candle is bright, the mourning is in mourning
Bulbulla Delhi tied up in this chaman
We are the new
Let's say it is a jerk.
The last poet is the silence of Jahanabad
Now where that bankruptcy, they are fond of style
The fire was not a young man in Kafur Perry
The tongue was on the stain that the desire is in every heart
Leila meaning is there in a veil, or in the midst of
Now who will ask Saba to ask the secret of Sakot Gul
Who will understand
Was in the flight of not neglecting the fact
Eye in the flight of the tire
And will show us the nuances of the articles
Flexual scaling of your thoughts
The bitterness will draw maps and cry
Or the new world of imagination will see us
This chaman will be born even
There will also be hundreds of seasons, sir Ijaz
The Azar will get up from the idol of thousands of poems
Will be wine from the new scale
Well, the book's interpretations will be very
There will be a lot of dreams
Hooboo will draw, but who is the picture of love?
Get up, Nauk Fagan, who will kill the heart?
Ashok's grains I sow in the earth's poem
You also cry out to the sketches
O Jahanabad, O Winter
Then today, the autumn of the palm
Those colors were your leave for example
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Was not probably in the dust of such a homeland
He was perfect in the dust of the Deccan
The eighty -five people who were, the maize was left empty
The monument of Delhi remained a recent
The desires of the desires
It kills in your darkness
Can't open for complaint but tongue
The color of the autumn is also the reason for the stay
The same law is all effective
From the garden of the Boy Gul, the journey from the world to the world

Syria's cruelty is in the grip of healing
In the delay of greatness
In an attempt to ignore the unhappy
We are in the sound of the courtyard of the courtyard

In the fountains, the beauty of the river, the beauty of the river
In the city, in the desert, in the desert, the beauty of the population
To the soul, but the lust of a lustful item
Otherwise, why is this desert?
It is also desperate in this common process of beauty
Life is an example of this.

English Translation: Bank Ravi
Scout Syria is a source of opinion
Don't ask me what is the heart of the heart
This zero of prostration was done to me
Where all the tasty haram was made to me
I am standing on the head
Not news to me but where do I stand
The wine has been colored with red
For the Monday, jam in the Flick
The caravan of the Ummah went to the fast
Not healing, these are the flowers of the sun as if
Standing away that greatness isolation
Minor Dreams
This is the Palace
There is a book of time of time
What is the location, the anthem is quiet as if
Shijar, this association is a blurred
There is a safety on the Sanۀ River
The waves are mixed with a warm -hearted
Subject is in Ravi, like this boat
The circle of the neck went away from the limit
The man of life is flowing
That's what is born in the sea of ​​Abid
It never gets acquainted with defeat
Hide from sight but not annihilation

English Translation: The passenger
The angels read the name that is your name
Big Mr. Tari, Faiz is normal
The stars are from your attractiveness of love
The system of seal is your system
The visit of the trip is the heart of the heart
The position of Christ is the high place
There is no love in your love
Great is, great respect is your
If the black heart, the stains of the lady
But Kasha Jabinam, Gul Spring, Um
Leaving the Chaman, I like Nakhit Gul
The patience is approved by me
From the homeland box to the leaving
The pleasures of alcoholism to me
Look at the tree, the trees are desert
God did not need me
Flickle addicts are sealing
From your prayers, they are giving me
Location We are from trips so much forward
That the caravan of the destination is to me
Don't let anyone's heart from the pen of the pen
Do not complain to anyone under heaven
Chocked the hearts, such as the effect of which
Such a foothold from your sir
I was made of the chicken.
Look at the Chaman again
Then come to the steps on the mother and the mother
What made me the secrets of love
That is the candle of the family
There will be such a harem that to me
From the map of whom my wishes
Made, whose point of view to me
Pray that the Lord of the heavens and the earth
Then the pilgrimage to me
He is my Joseph, the candle of love
There is a lot of love for me
The burning of whose love is the office
In the luxury of the air, what to do to me
Riyadh -e -dhar
That's dear to me.
Be the swollen heart flow of the heart
It will be accepted by the passenger

Wonder is, I am all the times.
How did I get this creation of nobility?
Something was to be seen on the demand
What do you know how you have a heartfelt decision?
There is also a call to be a demanding defendant
How did the chicken live on
Viewers see you here too
Then how did this promise try the patience of the beast?
Beauty is not perfect.
How did the curtains, how did it happen?
Death prescription is still pending
The fodder is crazy, how did I have a medicine
You have seen, O Did, the lesson
How did the colors of Ho be born from the dust?
The purpose was to do with actions
Otherwise it was obvious everything, what happened, how did it happen
Was the thing to see the spectacle of my mum
How did I tell them how I encountered me?

Have to see that no one can see
I am extremely love, you are very good
See me that someone will make a spectacle
The excuse is a crime of love
Do not produce fresh excuses in the forefront
This is not hidden.

This is also a bar to the view.

Those I used to find in the earth in the heavens
They came out in the residents of my cruelty Khan
Reality appeared on his eyes when his
Makkan came out in the residents of our hearts
If something was unfamiliar with the joke
So the Ka'bah of the Ka'bah was found in the jibes
Have ever done your own
That is, like Leila, it is itself in the midst of the nuns
Months are flying watches
But the watches pass through the months
You will stop you, O Nakhda from being drowned
That those who are drowning, are drowned in safin
Hidden beauty from his claim to Allah.
The same is the Nazi offers
The candle can burn.
What is the Divine Hide in the hearts of the people of the heart
If you are a heartache, then the service of the poor
Not found in the treasures of Gohar kings
Do not ask for these folders, if you are intended
There are a lot of sitting in their sleeves
The sight of the sight of which is the view
He is the association of the association.
Brame from such a wicked heart to your heart
That the Day of Resurrection should be in your happy chains
Loving a heart for love
This is the wine that keeps in delicate ancestors
The curse becomes beauty, whose beauty lover
Oh my heart, there is no such thing in the senses
Any of your pay on your 'ma' alfna '
In all of the rise, you have been in the ranks
Be prominent and let them ever be aesthetic
There are very long -term discussions
Smewed, Oh, not good at a packed game
Literature is the first one in the lovers of love
I think badly, I can't happen to me
That I myself am also in my nostalgic Chinese

Whoever is defeated, does a secret secret
Someone asked what the sermon worsens
The mercy of which he should also be relieved
Swelling in Sakhan, where does the Divine come from
This is the thing that can also be stored on the stone
The difference is from Lala and Gul
Where I do not discriminate

Like the raw is on your tongue
Also leave a strange thing
The words of love that are not the heartache in the heart
It is not a matter

Not a trade, this worship is God's

Qamar looked strange in his clothes.

Now the world was out of the oppression of the world

The perfection of the poem was just as it was.
Havida was a naked fountain
Heard that there was a chemistry in the world
There was a cleansed
I was written on the face of the Throne
The angels were hidden from the springs of Adam
The eyes used to be in the utensils but of the chemistry
He knew this recipe from the prime minister
Enhanced glorification of the Throne of the Throne
Tamanah, the end of the end came from
The thoughts of the thought were made in the field
Does hide?
Ask from the stars, ask for a liver from the moon
Flying swimming with a slight nightmare
Found with electricity, purely purely
Heat from the Messiah of the Son of Mary
Just then take the glory of the Lord.
Humility from the country, the destiny of Shabnam
Then the ingredients in the water of the springs of the beast
The Mercab found the love name from the Throne of the Prime Minister
Mahuis sprouted this water on the noses
The knot opened from his universe
The same thing, the particles left the dream of the joy
The throat began to get up from his own sympathy
The sun was found, the stars
Founds, the stains were found.

English Translation: Beauty
The beauty of God asked this one day
Where I did not give me everlasting
The answer is that the picture is the world
Shabbat is a tragedy of the world
The color has happened when the appearance of it
That is the senses of the truth.
Somewhere close, this conversation was heard by Qamar
Flick was commonplace, Akhtar Sahar listened
Saheer listened to the stars and heard Shabnam
Flick told the eyelashes of the land
The tears of the flower are filled with tears
Cali's little heart has become bleeding with grief
Spring weeping from Chaman
Shabbat had come to Si, went mouring

English Translation: Drink
Love has made you familiar with the taste
Give Bazam a candle for a bizarre
The orbit is on the verge of love.
He was imprisoned for the harem, whom he was indifferent to
The candle does not meet the light of the light
To whom God does not give up in the dar's
In the stars, he, in Qamar, he, in the morning
Do not give you a distinction in the eye of the spectacle
Love is a high hair
Beauty is the best if you also answer
Monday is the effect of fringe wine
It is not a grief in it, give me a box maker
You do not know whether Bazam has changed
Now do not give them wine for God

We are from the Bar River O Qatar
It was previously Gohar, without now Gohar rare
Ah, who paid what you played secrets and smells
I am still in a state of discrimination
Mitta's ghogi made the insurgent of life
These evils made the fire of the fire
The negative entity is a charisma
There is a pearl in the river of La
The hidden meaning is the end of the eyebrow
The tail, which is tired, is raw
Breaks idols to Abraham's love
The consciousness is as if the love

This is the heart of my heart
If you are a game, I am a riot.
The beauty of the beauty is you, I am of love
If you are sunset, then you are a shabnam
If I am poverty

Die from the picture is a surprise
The beauty is perfect, your love is perfect
You are a spring for the garden
You have given my despair to the imagination
Ever since the inhabited love was in the chest
In the mirror of the new essence
Beauty is the nature of love
The heads of you are green with my hopes
The caravan has become mysodۀ destination

English Translation: Looking at the cat in the lap
Who taught you to look at you
Who told the beginning of love
Every pay is born of love
The blue eyes dripping
Sees them sometimes, sometimes ashamed
Sometimes gets up, sometimes sleeps
Eye is amazing what is wonderful
What is the bright recognition of light awareness
They kill them with ponds, strangely
Is it teasing, anger or a style of love?
If you are hobby, you will take off the dock
Falls falling into the chest.
What is the curiosity, whose wishes are you?
Ah, are you the same thing?
There is no sense of beauty from a particular person
The heart is the heart of everything
Glass is like a naab in a darling
The spirit is Khurshid, the blood of the vein is love
The heart is hidden in every particle
Noor. It is a glimpse of everything that is in
Somewhere in the goods, there is a grief somewhere
Somewhere is Gohar, somewhere Ashk, somewhere else is Shabnam

By maps in the cinema.
The silence is not underway.
Now the effects of where I do not worry
My lyrics do not pray to the family
The heat of love becomes the blisters
Play the drain now with the lightning.
This is a mirror from the Ghaz -e -Walf
And the mirror in the mirror is long

The heartbreak of my house was populated
The wicker of this Khurshid from Zoo is dead
The moonlight whose shy is ashamed

Oh, fasting

Everything is in the same thing as Jamal

Even though Hussein is fresh
I have a strong scale from beauty
Born from indifference to my nature
I have a swollen instrument like Saba
According to the spectacle, the evil
May not be the heart of the heart.
Every requirement is the nature of love that is quiet
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
As the jokes of the whole, the ingredients are me
The beauty is unconscious, I have pain
The pain of life is from the injuries
I keep love free of charge
If the truth is asks
I have a new pioneer in the heart every moment I
Faiz -e -Shabbat Shabnam Asa, Zarif -hearted River
I am under fire.

Then for whom I have an end
In the wilderness of the wilderness
The waves of the Mediterranean

But it comes to Nassim
The winds from the sides of the sides

Songs of Yas Yas rises
Ashok's convoy rises
The way that is the shabnam is from the jokes
The height of my nature is from the sorrow

I have fallen asleep in Aghosh
Something like this is a suck
The knicker can also be able to
The wires have a quiet caravan
This caravan is flowing
Silence is the mountain and the river
The power is as if
Oh my heart, be quiet too
Sleep the grief in Aghosh

English Translation: Love
Listen to the pain of the pain, you are nervous
I am the heart of the Ghaznavi Somnat
Not associated with the surroundings of the world
All of your chest is in your chest, you should also be a mirror
Therefore, it is perfect for life to be perfected
Where the duty is ancient, you should be an example of prayer
Do not be content with Him
If you are in the chaman, then you are overwhelmed
That is not the time of the desert, the deserts
Where I become a candle -like meaan concert
The people are virtual, the nation is the real
Be the fire of the fire, that is, the fire.
They are doing the Indian sectarian Iqbal as if
Be a hug of the baby from the feet of the baby

The burning of the shouting that the candle of the nostrils is "

Cry now, open your heart
It is visible that the shrine of civilization
Here was the turmoil of these deserts ever
Was the packet whose safety ever
Earthquakes from which the emperors were in the courtyards
The asylums of the lights whose swords were in
There was a message of freshness whose appearance
The eate of the contemporary, whose nausea
The dead universe was alive with the trouble

From the skeptics whose deliciousness is still
Is that Takbir silent now forever?
Ah, O Sisali Sea

Zeb stayed on the river with your pure
From your candles to the Mediterranean
Ho Subsky Passenger Passenger
Madam on the cliffs of your coast
You were once the cave of the civilization of this nation
The beauty of the universe who had a fire
Nalash Shiraz's bubble on Baghdad
The stains of the blood on the blood of the blood on the world
The heaven was destroyed when the wealthy
Ibn Badr's heart shouted
Grief was given to Iqbal
The destiny was that the heart was that I was a mahram
Who is hidden in the artifacts
The style is in the silence of your coast
Tell me the pain, I am also a curse pain

Teach a little crazy to the Divine Wisdom
It is a bargaining, I don't have a headlines
The swelling of love is to tell me the angels in the morning
Examples are the shrine of you, you have no association
Where we are here, it is unfamiliar, O heart
That thing you ask for me is that there is no such thing
The quirky
Winning is not the homeland of our country
Where to come, where to go, deceive is the discrimination
Namod is in everything we have, our homeland is nowhere
Say my message to someone from the 'repository'
Nations that are doing something, do not have fun
٭
The time will see when the dead will rise from the heart of the conversation
Murray is not silent, as if the shrine is the letter of the letter
The river is based on the river, the journey, Shan is my
Well, it is Sadaf to be drunk.
Do not, those who are worthy of training, do not listen to training
The mirror of the mirror in the water of the lush
No heart looks like a dream
What is Divine Your World, Nigar House
Open that life was his own, it was a curse
The khaki, who used to think of the body, was a khoki wishes
If there is nothing
Niga wants to look, the heart is a bargain as it is
In Chaman used to say, the ghosts, why is it so bad?
In the eyes
Riyadh is the particle of the personality of love.
If you understand the fact that you understand, it is also a scale of color and smell
All the subjects dead, the word curse my sin
Skil
Space is a condition of literature, otherwise karma is more than persecution
He has given a little heart, he is also a deception of wishes
The unity of the perfection is clear that you are the tip of the nostrils.
Sure, the drop from the gray vein of a human being
The era of imitation has been taken, the authorized journey
The fact that when prominent is the conversation
I am far from home, I am not dear to me
For example, the dignity of the country is amazing

English Translation: The time has come for the hijab, the general vision
The curtain was a veil, whose secret will now be revealed
Now, now the farmer who used to hide was drinkers
The whole world will be made, everyone will be humiliated
Sometimes those who were jumped, they will come back to the slums
The naked pie will remain the same, but the new one will be
Hijaz's silence finally
The covenant that was tied to the deserts, then will be a savior
From the Nickel Desert who overturned the Roma Empire
I have heard this from the cords, I will be smart again
What is the mention of the Sakhi in the Association of Destruction
So on Monday, he said, "The mouth is burst, it will be disgraceful
The inhabitants of the Diyar -e -West are not God's township
What you think is, it will now be less vulnerable
Your civilization will commit suicide with your dagger
Joshukh will become a delicate
Safin Berg will make the caravan of the caravan
Thousands of waves are shaking but it will cross the river
In Chaman, the red shines
It knows that this show will be counted in the heart
Who was one, O look, you showed us a thousand
If this is the quality of you, then who will trust
Saying that I have been a day, freely here, free of charge
So they said, "This will be the secret of our chaman
There are thousands of lovers of God, throw away in Bannu
I will be the servant of the one who loves the servants of God
This ritual is annihilated, O heart is a sin.
Will you be the one who will be ours here?
I will take my brutal caravans in the night
It will be myself, my meal, the map will be a flame bar
There is no non -nasal one that the defendant is your life
So in a map where you will be exemplified
Don't ask for Iqbal's abode, it is now his condition
Somewhere in the head, the persecution will be waiting

It was trembling with Roma, their burial
The land of the land is also the light of the Muslim

And the civilization of the present is done

The birth of your greatness was your land
The relief of you in this emperor to this Emperor

The name of which was made by the proud scholar
The successors of Caesar, the heir to the gym
If the nationalism is a place of restraint
India is the foundation of it, neither Persian, nor Syria
Ah, you are a Muslim, you are a spelling
You have the rays of the absorbent effect

English Translation: Friendship
Two stars in the kirs
Saying one, from the other
What good if it is a connection
What good if you have the end?
A little bit that is the kind
We both have the same shine
But it is the desire of the recovery
Message was a curse
The rotation wires are the sabotage
Everyone is the way
Is the dream stability
The Constitution is where the separation is

Heaven found on the arrival of Khurshid
The flight of the night wearing a flight
Flame Khurshid is a farm of this farm

It is like a najam -e -Sahar, like a synagogue
Go to the forefront of any Abid night
What is the way that no one slowly
Draw the brutality of the Mayan's cruelty

Like a wine in the house of Mina
The morning is mixed in the morning
The insurgent, the sound of the voice
Sanja Sanja Sanjaya
There is a string of tricky law

I am always wandering
Love is in love with the destination as well
The heart is desperate
Messerra is where the pain of the painful
ابھی نا آشنائے لب تھا حرفِ آرزو میرا
The tongue was about to be tired
It came from the dead, to the residents of the harem
The complaint is from you
How do you know how to cool down
That I am in Leila, so far the same style
Neither 'La Allah' sowed from your land
Throughout the time, the delicate nature of the nature
You know what your life is ignorant
Consciousness, the naval church
There is a training in Aghosh Bait Allah
The heart is upset but the bargaining of the saint

English Translation: Philosophy
Although curse is a luxury
Ashk also holds the life of the life
The waves dance on grief
The Surah of 'Al' is also the Book of Life
If a single leaf is low, then it is not a glow
Autumn that is invisible, is not a bubble
The color of the blood of the desire is the heart of the heart
Song humanity is not perfect.
The stain is a lamp in Bina
The soul is the mirror of the luggage.
Accidents are from grief
Gaza is a constitutional heart for the heart
Grief awakens young
The maker is awakened by the same harm
Grief is a flight to the heart
The secret is the heart, the grief is the secret
No grief, a song of the soul is silent
Which we are ignorant of by the entity
Evening whose familiarity is not 'Lord'
The flames of which are not in the night of Ashok
The heart of which is in the grief of the heart of the heart
Which is always the luxury of wine
Hands with a glow
Love that is unaware of Hagar's frustration
The grief is far from his day and night
The secret of life is superior to his eye
O understanding the discipline, you get
Why are you not able to find the destination of grief
Is your love for eternal prescription
The intellect is human, mortal, living Javed Love
The evening is ashamed of the love of love
Love is a life of life, it is eternal
The purpose of the departure of the beloved would be annihilated if
Even the enthusiasm travels from a heartfelt lover
Love does not die from the death of some beloved
Grief remains in the soul, but does not go
The survival of the love of love is the beloved
Life is an unfamiliar beloved
Come to Nadi Jabin Koh
Songs to be taught to the sky
The mirror is bright.
On the rocks of the Gurur Valley it happens
The canal, which was, became his dear dear
That is, the stars of water from this epithet
Samabs burst into trouble
A world of inflammatory droplets became prominent
Hagar, these drops but the attachment of
On two steps then the same is the same as the string
One is in the realm of life
The crowd has become a crowd
We are separated to meet in the world
We cry out to the temporary
The dead die but not annihilated
It never really separated from us
The intellect is the disaster in the disaster
Or get rid in the dark night of youth
The heart has become a heart
The cruelty of the path is difficult to sleep.
The courage has been diligently
Worry when humble and silent voice conscience
There is no travel in the valley
Do not even show the evil of Jagnu
In the atrocities of the deceased are bright
The way the stars shine in the dark night

Prayer comes out of the tongue of Kali
"In the divine souls, that choice to me
Envy the sun to the sun. "
Break you from the branch
The rivals were kept in agony
The trauma of the lifting reached the end
The essence of life reached perfection
The dead are the ones who are in view of the personality
Murray Shabbat's gum is critical
Never this flower we have never been the respondent
Don't get acquainted with one's feet
Will not be able to do so
Waiting for the glows to the flames

In this period is wine and is jam and is gym and
The scriptures of the Bena are fun and persecution
The Muslim also built his harem and
Azar of civilization
These fresh gods are the greatest homeland
The paradox that is his, is the shroud of religion
The idol is that the trumpet is civilized
The ruler of the country is the prophet
The arm is stronger than the power of monotheism
Islam is your country, you are Mustafavi
Look at the long -standing age
O Mustafavi, mix this idol in the dust
Ho the prison is the result of destruction
Freedom of homeland in the sea
The country is Sunnah.
You also testify to the authenticity of the Prophet
There is something else in the politics of politics
The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is something else
The nations are where I am
The best thing is to trade with it
Empty is free from politics.
The house of the weak is from the same
The creatures of the nations are divided from it
The root of the nationalism is cut off from it

The beaches of this beach, the sea, are away

The survivors who survived, the heart of Ho, were swollen.
How joy did this Bukhari young man know
Found in the poisoning of death.
The dagger was as if he had Hilal -e -Eid
In the heart, the slogan on the lips was in the heart
Fear says don't walk alone towards Yarb
Hobby says that you are a Muslim, stupidly walk
What will I go again?
What will the lovers not show up on the day?

Fasting is fasting and neither obedient prayer
You are also perfect in Shiva Arbaba
In the heart of London, the lips are mentioned in the Hijaz
The lyrics are also a deliberate
Your style of Tamilk also cursed
The finished speech is on the government of the government
The worry is bright
There is also the authority of you.
Pauli also complexes
And like people you can hide
Please serve
You see the day of Eid in the mosque
Effects are from sermons.
There are also newspapers in the country
It is obligatory to tease
There is a sense that you can say poetry
Your median is in Sakhan
As much as the leader is, they are all in you
You must be upset with a partner
There is no grief, and there are hair
Then what is the reason, not the mind of you

The sword was lyrics, the person in Shujaat was
In purity, enthusiasm was a person in love

But the pearls of knowledge, books
Those who see them have a heart in Europe

Also look at the destination of the Rahu -e -Durmanda
Seeing you, we used to rob you
O Sagar, we see our ignorance today
The chains of sectarianism are Muslim prisoners
See also your freedom, see their arrest

In Dehra, I was false
The truth is that I have been in honor of
My entity is that of the Islamic world
My eraser is the discouragement of the Bani Adam
Fate of the universe is a Muslim
Whose sorrow is ashamed
The mystery of the mystery of my eyes is revealed
Can't tell me
When can draw a temporary scene of grief to me
Trust is on the sidelines of my own
Yas's Lord is free my employment
The conquest of the victory is reported
Yes, it is true
I say old -fashioned family
Remembering my dust is ausir
My past is my welcome interpretation
I put in front of this period
I see the person in the mirror of the person

Opening is in the jihad.
Every particle of your dust is dishonest
You hear from someone who is the fiction
Diamonds toward your grown pocket
Famous you where I am Diwan Hijaz

The pulse patient should be in the five Jesus

Hidden in the way that the facts are

I find death in the land of Hijaz
Have you come to take the healing message
Keep worked from the Messiah

English Translation: Of course
In Europe, the clock was left out of truth and falsehood
The right dagger was forced to test
The cross -crossed, the surrounding lunar circle
Thanksgiving was detained in the day
All of the Muslim soldiers stored
The hopeless eye has become an eye
Finally by the command of the rich militant
The 'Constitution of the War' became the customs
Everything moved to the depositor Lashkar
The king's donor became a worshiper
But the city of Faqiya heard this
Summer's like a sarcastic
"The wealth of the Holy Prophet is in the Muslim community"
Fatwa became famous all over the city
There was no touch
Muslim, forced by God's command

How cruel, Jafaju, Kinah was
Extract the eyes of the King Timori with a dagger
The people of the Haram were paid to dance
This style was nothing short of an archetype
Even compliance was possible for this decree
Emperor from the Haram of the Haram
The goods made of the goods made them
There was no beauty whose springs from the seal and month of Akhtar
The heart was delicate, the steps were forced
Like the river, the princesses of the princesses
Here are the eyes of the eyes for a while
What a nervous then the free head from the bargain
From the waist, get up and open, the fire opened
The lesson is the subject of Anjum whose essence
Kept the dagger forward and then lying on something
Sleeping was demanded from the springs
The water of the dreamed of his eyes was his eyes
From the painful scene of the tyrant's tyranny
Then he got up and said to the Timori Haram
You should complain
It was a texture to sleep on the dead, it was troubled
That negligence is far from the Lashkar -e -Lashkar
This was the purpose of died, no Timor's daughter
Kill me out of my dagger
But this secret was finally opened all over the time
The name of Hamit is the name of which, from the house of Timor

It has been recently done.

English Translation: Do you not remember that time of my heart
That literature is love, he is a refreshing
These are the contemporaries that are made in Madrasah
Neither pay is infidelity, nor trimmed
No, no graduation in this open air
This is where the strange is where, neither the coffee nor the Asiana
Rig Tak is waiting for the rain karma
That the wine of Ajam was not in the midst of wine
Murray, we also considered Safir as a spring
What do they know what this new lovers
Murray from the dust and the dust?
What is the martyr, then
Dying days are passing through the trumpet
Neither is a fury of friends, nor complaining

English Translation: Conscience Lala May Lal
Sufi broke down as soon as the gesture was found
There is a love that love it somewhere
He did the heir to the poor
These stars are old, Flick also
Wherever they want me to do now
Who knows what the uproar is
The rotation of the throat is my path
Do not snatch it with me
Do not do the nugget
The heart does not agree
Centuries are a lot of chimpanic
The hadeeth is unaware, so the time is
Timely, so many times

English Translation: That is my less fortunate, the same
Murray did not work.
Where am I, where are you, it is Lamak?
Where is the died where the tear charisma
Pass in the same conflict
Sometimes the Romans, sometimes the patchy
They are deceived by the deceitful ropes
What does he know about what is the Shahbazi
Neither did any lyrics, nor in awareness of the tongue
Whether it is a charming, a stranger or a fresh
No distinction in poverty and empire
This soldier's scandal, the nausea
Someone from caravan, no evil from the harem
That the rich caravan is not heartbroken

English Translation: I thought my place was under heavily
I think of the climate game where I was considered
The temptation of the three -way eyes from the hijab
One of the blueprints was considered to be heaven
The caravan was tired and left in the atmosphere
The seal and Jupiter we understood
One of the love of love has decided all the story
I thought this earth and heaven
Saying secrets of love
The one who considered it to be seized
There was a painful pain of a rash
I thought of the sound of the caravan

English Translation: An intellectual, a wise man
Is the wisdom of Burrani, surprise
There is a thing in this pack, so he is your
It is difficult for me to care for this item
Now what the fagan has arrived at the stars
You taught me this lyrics
Be map if false, what to get from repetition
Do you happy that Adam's passion?
Afrangi has taught me
Why are the times a Muslim?
Destiny is still in power
The ignorant of what is called destiny
Your also the roommate, my also
Both of the saints, both of them

English Translation: Or the Lord is good for the world but
Why are you disgraced
Even in his goddesses, there is also the hand of the mahjan
The world understands the fringe to the Lord
So Burg is the only person
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
The kebabs and wine are present in the church
The mosque has been involved in the mosque
The rules are right, but your commentary
Can make the proximals from Tawil
Firdous that is yours, no one has seen
Everybody's side is like Firdous
By the time you are worried
Do it now closed in the caves of the moon
Nature has forgiven me.
I am khaki but do not keep the dust
Darwish God is neither a masterpiece nor poverty
The house is neither my heart, neither the sarcasm, nor the Samarkand
I say the same thing as the right
I am a mosque, not the son of civilization
Your own also are angry with me, unhappy with the strangers
I could never tell poisoning
Difficult that a closed right -of -right
Tell me the tune of Khasak
They also silent in the flames of the fire
I am a closed believer, not a Dan
Swelling and nausea and lesson
Free and arrest
In all cases my heart is imprisoned
Will you snatch a taste of a tasting
I could not remain silent
Someone does this closed mouth

English Translation: Can't wear in nature
There was a lot of gossip
It can break the colors and smells of self
It was this monotheism that you neither understood nor understood
Creating a career, O ignorant is the same nature
That the river cannot be strangled by his waves
The richness of the scholars and the sake of the rivalry is a minaret
That he understood the solitude of the halj
God's servants in government, in slavery
If anyone is safe, then
Do not imitate O Gabriel my absorption

This is the Haram who steals and eats
Gleim -e -Boozar and Dilq -e -Awas and the Wahid of Zahra

"Arriva Chinese Ihram and Makki Khattak
The glass is a civilization.
But not in the hands of the Sakhi
Pressed by a sharp manual of injuries
Very down the tunes right now
It rises from the same river.
The nausea of ​​the naughty
What is slavery? Deprivation of Taste Hasan and Zebai
Whom Ziba somewhere is a free servant, the same Ziba

Anxiety does the kernel
Even though poverty also has style
Personal Empire is unprecedented
Now that poverty is not left in the Hajar Sufi
The blood of the heart is the document of the poverty
O throat, how is that man of God?
Be the route in which the poor
Which brightly bright with the heat of the mention
Which faster than electricity in the light of thought
Milky is the archeology
The lacks of Allah are Timor or Genghis
Thus Grandpa gives me Iraq and Pars
It is an infidelity

English Translation: The secret that I have been taught
May God give me a map of Gabriel, so let me say
What will the star inform the destiny
She is in self -styled
What is life, the idea of ​​ideas
The death of self is anxiety
Wonder is fun, giving me a pleasure
They want me not to be in my own
Conscience and the highest hobbies
Neither wealth, nor worries
The lesson is learned from me from Mustafa
That the universe is under the influence of humanity
This universe is now unlawful
That's coming, the moment is 'Kin Fayek'
Treatment is in the swelling of the Roman fire
Three microscopes are the dominant fringe
My eyes are bright with his feast
From his feast is in my Sabu

You are sketchy, I am the soil and myself
The water is flowing for the existence of the existence.

That item is something else that says to John
It is color and damp, it is a lot of climate

The wealth of the tan is shadow, it comes to wash

Then what is strange in it that you are not foolish
The tastes are also in the same dust
You are not aware of the ignorant
She's the eye that brightly brightly from the serpent offering

Do I know about Sufi and Milla?
Their heads are not yet chalked
How long have been the Murree dust in the subcontinent of Anjum
Or I don't, or the rotation is not
Lightning, the look is on the elbow
For me, Shayan is not a bit of anger
The scholar is the only legacy of the believer

If you are a believer, he is the Divine Divine
I also chalk the mystery
It is long

English Translation: This Hurriyan fringe, a hijab of heart and eyes
Paradise West, Religious
Take the heart and look
There are stars in the sea
The world cannot be heard
Latif is the whole of Faghani Chung and Rabab
He has taught it
The city of Faqiya has been done by Sufi
The prostration, the spirit of the earth from which the tremble
He is desperate today
I did not listen to Egypt and Palestine
Gave the mountains to the mountains
The wind is probably your effect
Murree is in Nawa Nava

English Translation: Awakened Farooqi, Heartbacks
Chemistry is in favor of Miss Adam
Creating a heart -wrenching that the heart is dreaming
Neither is your multiplication, nor my multiplication
Masam is faster in the desert
Tatar
How long do I keep on this anxiety
The spark of your fate
May God go to your simple heart?
That Darwishi is also a lawful, Sultanate
I am given the civilization that freedom
That apparently there is freedom, arrest in the inner
You are my ma'arba
Murray is wise

English Translation: The fondness of the self is not grateful
Even if it is Nazi, it is not a delight
Love is looking for a heart -living
The victim is not Shahbaz
Murri is not in the naval
That Bang Tars is not a pro -heart
Don't ask the question from the fringe
That this method is not a pure
Not common where I have ever been the government of love
The reason is that love is not the time
An anxiety is constantly, irritated that the Holy Prophet
If I say myself, Murree Dastan is not drawn
If so, then read in solitude
Faghan is not a secret secret

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
There is no life in your world
Looking for the waves, see Sadaf Sadaf
Love raised hands, sink into your own self
Do not have blood in the painter of the drainage
What do I open up
Love is the death of the death
This secret was revealed to me from the Monday
Millions of Hakim Sir Bajib, a Claim Sir Bakhf
For example, if there is no trial
The tree still comes from the tree.
Couldn't make me a jerk
The dust of my eye is Medina and Najaf

English Translation: Zamstani was in the air. Shamsher's fast
No hugs in London, even in London
Somewhere in the winter game was my hot talk
Somewhere all the troubles up
If the car is in the hands of the laborer then what
The same is the same in the method of Kohkan
Gloriously, the democratic spectacle
Something is left out of politics
Delhi is remembered in the tasty rumor
The same lesson, the same greatness, the same glory

English Translation: What is this delay, a pile
Hardly passing into it
No story of love for love
Laught
In the week and the two miles that were lost
You will not understand until you are colorless
A Muslim, a Muslim, a Muslim
Is absorbed by the Muslim head
O Lord, Farzana, absorbed Muslim
The path of the path was born of the branch.
The rituals are the foolishness of love
Not every hobby, not every passion, not every absorption
You will not sit
Or your poor chalk or a sore throat

English Translation: Not perfection
The perfection is abandoned.
I came from such a poverty
Your poverty
Not socks for poverty, nor for the kingdom
The nation that lost Timori
Listen to the goodness of the sake
The heat of the heat is the letter of disability
Hakim and Arif and Sufi, all the appearance
Who knows that the abstraction is the same
If they are confused, then the quench also freedom
If not, then the courtyard is also forced
Don't believe, just look at him

English Translation: The intellect is not away from the Astan
Not in his destiny
He also asked God for his heart
The light of the eye is not the light of the heart
Knowledge is also lying but
This is Paradise in which he is not Hur
Is it anger that at this time
Not a single sir
There is one who is conscious
There is one who is not conscious
Nabori is the heart of the heart
Ahh he's heart that not nasal
The secret of your death is helpless
If you are alive, you are not unconscious
Each Gentle broke the Sadaf
You are not ready

You understood it if you were not an option
Talmuds can break the kidneys
This is the building of Zajaj, not a stone
In yourself, then they also come up
But this is not a man of hatch
The location is to be identified
That the sketch is alive, you are not subject to the star
There is also paradise, there is also a good and Gabriel

That Perhane told me not to be mercury
Wrath is, in the same karma is the nature of nature
That Lal Nab is on fire, not an evil

Three life from this, the three of them
If you have been a royal, if you are not, then Russia
You did not mark me, O Hakim, you
What do I have to do with you, you do not live
Murray is still undergoing training in the throat
They know the ass
These are the cases fragile, which is the pleasure

Your sin is a sin of the nichel
The throat was slammed by the madrassa
Where did the Sada 'La Allah Allah'
The self is lost in God, seeking to find
This is the way for you now
Ask the Hadith of the Hadith
May God inform you of your place
If there is a naked head, then create a determination

The death of self is your fall.
Wake up in the madrassa and the monastery
No life, no love, no cognition, nor sight

These nonsense fell in prostration when the time came
Come on, O watch the spectacle of my poverty
The concert got up, which came to me with a distance
Di Iqbal has given Hindi Muslims to swell
It was a man of ease, the task of ease
For years I have been doing the same Iqbal
After great periods, he finally came under the price

English Translation: Do not be a joke, I do not live
What is my life, this is the same
Forcing me on nature Nava
Right now in the concert maybe there is no pain.
That fire can still be broken today
Do not ask for you, then what is the doubt?
Do not evaluate his
That is from the lightning lamps, the essence of this essence
The hearts do not rise in the heart
In the eyes, if not created, the universal
When could I come in the autumn, I was in the throes of Ziyad
Murray was sad and low of the branch
The plans will change, the destiny will change
The truth is, not my imagination this space

English Translation: By the way of nature
By color and color
You have lost your self
Doing the lost item
The atmosphere of strings is baked
You also wish this place
There are a lot of chamans
Religious to the Gul and Lala
Not faded. Although nature
What could not happen to him, you

English Translation: This pyranic church and haram
The reward is his pudding effort
Certainly produce, O Unseen
The Darwishi, who is bowing down
Sometimes wonder, sometimes fun, sometimes
Thousands of colors are my pain
Things are beyond the limits of love
Understand that the heart is death, the distance
They are forced to do their beauty
Murray is in the eyes of the eyes.
No one can understand the logic of destiny or else
There were no less than Timori than the Ottoman Ottoman
How did Iqbal come to the hands of the Haram
Misar Marrow Sultan is not Shaheen Kafuri

English Translation: Fresh, then the wise
It is not possible to go through this period
Wisdom is wit, make a hundred disguise
Love is neither unconscious nor Zahid nor Hakim
Luxury is forbidden to the poor of love
All are passengers, seemingly visible
You are a great sadness.
Like the river and the river
The capital is the capital of freedom and death
This curriculum is for someone else's sake

Thy, not from life these atmosphere
Here are hundreds of caravans and too
Do not contemplate the universe on color and smell
There are more ashes and as well as
What sorrow if a loser is lost

There are more heaven in front

Pir Haram said, "Sunnah's death
It is time for you, no longer hold it in the heart
Was the Eruni Go Claim, I am not a
Required by it, forbidden to me
Although the secrets of the secret, the people of the eyes

Ah that the secret of the poor is lost

English Translation: Be it self -knowledge, the department is gabriel
If you are from love, then the Super
I am aware of the punishment of wisdom
That I have been put into this fire, such as Khalil
The deceitful microscope is the caravan otherwise
The more relief is from the destination
If not, then do not sit in the throat
The point is that they are the essence
I miss those teaching fringes today
Where the pleasure of the Holy Prophet, where the hijab is the argument
The dark night is, the one is from your caravan
There is a lot
Poor and simple and colorful is the story of the harem
It is very Hussein, the beginning of Ishmael

Is there a mystery in the monasteries?
The destination is far away, too difficult
Is there anyone in the convoy of the convoy?
It is from Khyber
Is there any Haider karma at this time?
Beyond the limit of knowledge, for the believer
There is also a passion, a blessing

There is also a slight base, the mirror wall is also

English Translation: Do not be released in the throat of Sufi
Passen miracles remained
Poor Sultan and Monastery Faqir
The throne of the throne
Shame on the day of the day
Simple and Simple of the Book of Sufi
Neither Chinese nor Arabiya, nor Roman and Syrian
I could not understand the universal of the men
Shabana's fun has been done, but
The charisma breeze in the hearts of the heart
The bitter noy in Chaman is dead
That poison also does the car
Dearly, the rich and the rich

Even though the Western jinn were clever
Wine is a conscience of conscience
The fortunate madrassa or the Lord this waterfall
The height of man is looking forward to khaki
These galaxies, these stars, these blue
This is the time of the contemporary universe
The brain is bright and heartbroken
If you are foolish, it is also a contraction
Otherwise the fire is a believer, where there
The intellect is understood
Who knows that those who are also aware
Where all is inherited by the believer
My Word is Hajj

Which is in the courtyard of the man of Qalandar
The gender is where and the men are right
This is the point that the invisible is in the law
He is the one who created you?
This is not a compulsion, which is in the eyes

Murray does not look at Kufa and Baghdad
This madrassa, this young man
They are from the tail
Neither the philosopher, nor from the mullahs, to me
This heart death, that mischief of anxiety
What is the disgrace of the city of Faqiya
But the thing that I find is a heartbreak
Can buy the world in the world
The religion of God
I have done
To be a madrassa and a monastery
Do not be broken by the ropes of Rishi
If there is no rod

Or continuously in the voice of the Holy Qur'an
Or the glorification of the dust
He is the Most High of the Most Messenger and God
This religion and the plants and the plants
Rabbat
The rituals of the haram
The church's paid merchandise
Tuberculosis
Not this time of the people

You have dealt with pride
False interests, Allah is Allah's Divine
This wealth of the world, this relationship
Battle of God, Allah Almighty Allah
The microscope is the epitome
No, I am not a beacon, Allah is Allah

Is your midwife and the moon right now
In the name of a philosophical Sayed Zada
If you do not lose your own
The adulteress would not have been burnt
Hegel's Saddaf Empty
It is all the imagination
How is the department?
How to be selfish
Adam is seeking stability
The customs are demanded
Be the world of the world from which Iraq
The believer's willingness
I am a special Sometime of origin
The ancestors are dead and celebrated
So the descendants of Sayyid Hashmi
My cuffs
The philosophy is in my climate
Is hidden in fiber hai heart
Iqbal, though, is a neutral
Her vein is tracking the vein
Shu'a is a swelling of the jinn
Listen to me this point of heart
The end is inhabiting
The philosophy is away from life
The songs of thought are unheard of
Death for tastes are
Give the profession of life
Give Sar Muhammad and Bahim

The heart is not a dead heart, to resurrect it
That is the fodder of the people of the country
Is it possible for you, is it coins or a trap?
There is no new
You are not familiar with the heavenly conscience
No, you are saddened
Murray songs were put into the nasty
One who was not in the murky was in the mood
It will be visible to him.
Whose Misser Murray
World
I also look

You are, what you see, not
Mass
Disguise of turning
Even though Adam is, you are kicking
This is a prostration that you think of Grand
Thousands of prostration gives a man's salvation
The Holy Prophet
The wise is not punctual
Rahel is a source of life.
Thoughtlessness, the absorbing action is baseless
It is hard to be bright.
How well -done?
Life is not you.
Beat
Mujahideen heat is not in the Sufi
An excuse for the wine
The city of Faqiya is also forced
That the war of the Shariah is devastated
Avoiding the life of the dead, the dead
If there is no defeat and what is defeat

English Translation: Wisdom and heart
Every khaki and no government is a microscope
Not out of the wise of the wise God
The world is the slave of his glory
There is a heart that every moment is confused
Gust of character
Only in the context of Sufi
Only a joke in the law of Mullah
The poet of the poet and the ignorant and the ignorant
In thought, no dream, nor awakened
They do not see the mujahid
Be the only role in the veins
Bold
The death of the deceased did not come to him
The rest of the Qalandar does not have a dust
Silence is in the grave but
The prisoner is not a prisoner
Qalandar's identity
It says that from time to time, these young men
Going down, the right, you go away
There are more than my tri -power
Pass through Qalandar
I will not be in need of a boat
There is a climbing river if you go down
Did not break your magic Takbir?
If you are the cause of the death of you
Qalandar is accountable for sealing
Ayam is not a member, Qalandar is Qalandar
Philosophy
Ideas are the secret of the young men.
Not hidden from the eyes of the man of Qalandar
Know me that I am also
It was passed through the same path
Does not confuse the patch of words
Gosh is meant to Sadaf
Born only in the throat of the Arabs
That is the intellect that comes from the evil
The meaning of the complex confirms the heart
The price is a lot of rise
Or is the dead or arrested in a state of disrepair
The philosophy that was not written from the liver
Mardan God
He is the closet that is a shit
It is not that the Herb is the one of which
From the beginning, there have been in nature
Qalandari and Kabiya
Take the time that the sun does
They are hidden in their dust
The existence of them is free from the tawaaf
These believers and unbelievers, all the adornments
The unbelievers and the believer
On the coast of the river yesterday, Khazar told me
Are you looking for Sims?
One point is like Shamsher
Breastfeeding and bright and bright
The unbeliever's identity that is lost in the universe
The believer's identity that the lost is in it
Mahdi
All are in their own lives
The reward of the soil is that the seir of Afring
I am a church that is a harem
The innovation is an innovative role
There are the same pitches of politics
The poet arrested in the same poverty
The world is required for this Mahdi
Be it with the influence of the earthquake
Believer
Be the throat, so soft like a brithem
If Razam is right and wrong, then steel is a believer
From Aflak is its richness
The khaki is but free from the dust
Do not look at Kanjashk and baths in his eyes
Jabriel and Sarafel are the believers

Fraud from the courtyard
Astana of God
But this is a period
The style is the magic of all
Source life is dry
Where is the rest of the wine
Empty of them
It was a refreshing gaze
The house which is a lamp
It is a joke
In essence, what is the fear
Education is a fringe
The branch on the branch
By doing it in your own self
He is the sea man whose
Each drop is the backer
Delivery if not.
Every pine is a thousand thousand pineapple
"The negligence of the ignorant
Time -talent. "

Even the nature will not recognize me
That is, the other is the place of Mahmud
Why not Muslim in the seriousness of the seriousness
That is, such as slavery, such as Zajaj
Is this believer's prayer
Whose takbir is in the mood
Now where in my mafia that heat, that gadz
Then, in the meantime, my blessings and blessings
My bangs are neither elevated, nor doubtful
Do you want to decorate such Muslims?

Comfortable, Samab Samab
Bid that I should be granted leave
Unless it is, every particle of the east is where
I will not leave the dark atmosphere of the hand
Unless you get up, the dream of a deadly dream
This is the dust of the hopes of the soil
This is the soil of Iqbal's gestures
The springs are on the sidewalk with the same dust
This is the soil whose treasury
They are rising from this dust.
For whom every ocean is sore
The instrument whose songs were in the hearts
The same instrument of the game is strange.
The idol sleeps at the door of the idol
Crying destiny is Muslim
From the east, not to the west
Fifty indicates that every night is
Housed
Competition is good for the times
Even though I were not soldiers, the rich
I don't know it is poetry or something else
I have been granted to me.

This glory is filled with conscience
This is not inferior, no less than a coffee

Why do I get worse, why do I feel bad?
All the tools of civilization are you, I am shaking
You reject my bargaining
Have you not broken the weaker nations?
Who are these museums
The capital is, but the rest is neither king nor Raj

English Translation: Know who the destiny of India is so far
Poor is a crowning nail
There is a dead body of a grave
The shroud that is still under the ground
Even the Grino, non -body
Sorry that the rest is neither bee nor mask
You were willing to slavery in Europe
I have a sug of you, not from Europe
Gloomy
Where the angel needs civilization
No, the present in this time
Where there is no lunar
Where they are forbidden to say that
The body is in the body.
The method is not from now
As a child, the child is a child
Not the fountains of Faiz School
This is the fatwa
He is in the land of a land nowadays
Laden politics
Whatever is right, he does not hide from me
God has given me the heart of the heart
Murray is in the eyes
The so -called and dead conscience of the kinship
Has been a ruler free from the Turkish church
The politics of the fringe is a devotee
It is non -existent when the look is
So are the ambassadors of the Harol Lashkar -e -Churchia
Civilization
Iqbal's doubt is not in his nobility
Everyone is the oppressed European buyer
This is the miracle of the church that he
Ideas with lightning lamps
It burns but the heart of Syria and Palestine
It does not openly opened.
Out of the claws of Turkan 'Jaffa profession'
The poor are arrested in the trap of civilization
Advice
One of the fringe said, "From his back
The scene should ask for you not to be your eye
This is the biggest cruelty in favor of the poor
If you raise the rules, the lion
The secrets in the sun are better
Do not do subjugated from the scandal
Put into the acid of education
If you want to be created, then it turns it
The effectiveness is greater than the oxyer
If gold is a Himala
A naval pirate and Alexander
Authoritarian
The reward is your tear chain or Shamsher
That is fed up with your river
Pirate
Alexander Haif, you think of it as a man
Do we do like this?
You are a profession, brutal, dead profession
That we are pirates both, so Midani, in the river
Jamaat nations
Poor has been suffering for several days
Fear is not bad.
Destiny looks like
The prayer of the Pyran Church is to be avoided
It is possible that this is a piercing
The amulets of the Iblis will be handled for a few days
Syria and Palestine
Randan Francis'
Each glass halk from wine is glowing
If the Jews are right in the Palestine
Why not have the right to Spain
The goal is to do something else
Not a story of orange or honey and rituals
Leader
Hope is from the leaders of politics
They are dust, keep the dust from the dust
Always looks at peacocks
Where I am, the Subsites
Khushi the caravan, which is rich
Thanksgiving and passionate
Psychology
The causes of the Ummah are hardened
Open and say, the laziness
The Imam of the slaves in the religion of Sherry
Let's see only a philosopher
If the power of the Pharaoh is dead
The curse is in favor of the nation
Prayer of slaves

English Translation: He said that Mujahid -e -Turki prayed for me after me
Why are your imams such a long prostration
That simple man of mujahid, that believer is free
What did he know about what was the slave?
There are thousands of works in the world
Their tastes are from the system of the Ummah
The body is deprived of the slave.
That is forbidden on the day and night of the slaves
What is a surprise if there are long prostrations
What is the work of the poor prostrate
May God bless the Imams of the Hind
The prostration in which the life of the life of the country is
Palestine
The time is not still the time of which the swelling
I know that he is in existence
Tari Dawa is neither in Geneva, nor in London
The fringe vein is in the five yuhud

English Translation: Love is not a froma in love
It is not possible for Shahbaz
Even so can the customs change
That the nasal is a tremendous thing

Dead, demand for demand from fringe
If you look at the heart of the heart
The eyes of a believer are the wrong way

That is in his poverty

English Translation: The gaze is not the one who recognizes the red and the yellow
The sight is that the needy is not the month
The destination is far ahead of the fringe
Stepped this place is not extremely path

Fresh freshness is not sinful
There is also a hidden death in the same head
If the body is not 'Lalah' in the body
Will I hear my Saddanzadan Kabir?
I am not a sir.

Graduate him from wherever
Otherwise, the universe is in Syria
In the poverty, Mehsud is mine
Crying with the narrow sparrows
Iqbal said from Shaykh -haram
The riots are cold
The Hadith of the believer is heartfelt
Disagreement from Kharu
Do not mention the Freedom
Why not storm in your river
By the eyes of the Goddess
Never emerge from the river like a wave
Regardless of the Kashmiri Kashmiri
Water is the cramps of springs
Death is a hard -hitting name
Today is Kashmir.
When the subordinate nations get hot
Shaukat Shahs are on a flight
Runs also know that Sufi's perfection
Exit and perform from the monasteries
Understand the drop of blood if it is good
Open when the book in Chaman
Azad's vein is stiff like a vein
All Arif Self -Self
The other where the power of them
The narcissist is the living nations in the age
The unbelieving gambling of life
The conscience is the West, the merchant, the conscience is the east
Do not need O letter rate rates
Self -awareness has taught that the forgotten
I am determined to be a lively liver
In the poor cities, listen to you

I know that in the dark night of the east
There is an indifference to the Haram
Contemporary is from contemporary requirements but this fear
Do not go to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
100 times from the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)
Hafiz Nams Zin, Men Test, Male Offers
The message of death for every species of slavery
Some fugitives and families, the poor
Does wealth clean from every pollution
Makes wealth and wealth.
What more and more of what a revolution of thought
It is Allah, not of the kingdoms
These are hidden from the universe.
It is rich that the believer himself is deprived
This is the better theology.
This book is entangled in the interpretations of Allah

English Translation: Break whose takbir dimensions
No, the dark night of this God -fearing
Ibn Maryam died or is alive
Are the attributes of the truth, the separation of the truth or the same?
From the coming, the Messiah is the destiny
Or the Mujaddid, who is the attributes of the son of Mary?
The words of the word Allah are an accident or ancient
In what belief in the late Ummah is salvation?
Is it not enough for Muslims in this period
Does this theology kicked out?
You keep it strange from the universe
So in life, I am all seals
Well in it, the believer slave remaining till the Day of Judgment
For the sake of leaving the world
The same poem is good for it
The spectators from the eyes of the one who hide
Everyone is afraid of the awareness of this nation
The reality of which is the accountability of the universe
Keep it in the morning
In the mood of the monastery, it is strong
Badhai Baloch's honorable son
May the wind of your siblings you
It is better than this trash, neither heart nor forgive
In any direction in any direction, the sales are flowing
The valley is ours, that desert is ours
The great thing is in the world
Wearing Darwish to the Crown
Make it a hidden hin from someone perfect
Saying glasses can be made
The destiny of the nations is in the hands of individuals
Each person is the star of the sacred
The river was deprived of the river.
Do not do what the shores from the coast
If free by handing the other hand
There is a loss of Muslims in such a trade
The world is then offered a spiritual spirit
Civilization then raised its beans
Trusting to God in a believer
Alaius to resort to European machines
What is destiny, no one can say
If the believer is fruitful, then it is sufficient
Demanding sincerity from a new song
"Shaheed that weird Gada Banawazand Gada Ra"

Who knows what this is nourishing and semia
The one who was born from the dust, he was in the dust
But whether it is an unseen or annihilation, what is
The balloon path has been forgiven
God cannot tell what is the prayer
The heart and eyes are the same climate
Otherwise, what is the end of Hazrat?
Where the spirit of the spirit is' La Allahu Allah,
Messiah and Chilipa, what is this episode
To whom to ask for bloodshed
Who is sinful, and what is shed
Missing that the arrests are closed
Talisur Happy
Self is alive, then death is a place of life
That love does by death
The self is alive, so the river is a river
There is a lot of fun in the nail and the Euphrates
Self is a dead, like a dead
Self is alive, then the Sultan of all the present
The look is from an abstinence if deprived
Two hundred thousand articles are compensated
The location is closed to the believer
All the kicks from the earth
Haram is the eternal
There is no dust, nor the attributes
There is a lot of time for the sketches.
The seal and the star and the star
Censor
It comes from the Throne of the Throne in the morning
How to get lost
How to find out how much of your research
Why don't you do the liver of the stars
You are guilty of the caliphate
What is the case?
Why not be subjected to seals?
Why don't you shake your eyes
So far it is still in the thy veins
Heat thoughts, not worried
Brightly it is, where there is no
The eye that is not in the veil
The rest will not be your mirror conscience
Oh, the Sultanate and the Military

Ever down in the chest of the river
Ever passing through the coast of the river
