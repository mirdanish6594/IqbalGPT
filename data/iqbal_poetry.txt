(From Shikwa - The Complaint)
Kyun ziaan kaar banun, sood framosh rahun?
Fikr-e-farda na karun, mahw-e-gham-e-dosh rahun.
English Translation: Why should I be a loser, forgetting gain? Not thinking of tomorrow, lost in yesterday's pain.
Explanation: The poet questions a state of passive acceptance and advocates for proactive thinking and ambition. He urges the reader to focus on future gains rather than dwelling on past sorrows.

(From Jawab-e-Shikwa - The Response to the Complaint)
Hum Toh Mayal Ba-Karam Hain, Koi Sayil Hi Nahi
Rah Dikhlaein Kise, Rahraw-e-Manzil Hi Nahi
English Translation: We are inclined to be gracious, but there is no one to ask. Whom should We show the way? There is no traveler on the path.
Explanation: The divine response suggests that grace and guidance are available, but humanity is not striving or seeking it. The problem is not the lack of help, but the lack of effort and desire from people.

(Concept of Khudi - The Self)
Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle
Khuda bande se khud pooche bata teri raza kya hai.
English Translation: Elevate your self so high that before every decree of destiny, God himself asks you, "Tell me, what is your will?"
Explanation: This is the core of Iqbal's philosophy of "Khudi" or "The Self". It is about self-realization, self-respect, and human potential. By developing one's self, an individual can become a co-creator of their own destiny, acting in harmony with the divine will. Khudi is not about arrogance, but about understanding one's true potential and purpose.

(Concept of Shaheen - The Eagle)
Nahi tera nasheman qasr-e-sultani ke gumbad par
Tu shaheen hai, basera kar paharon ki chattanon mein.
English Translation: Your abode is not on the dome of a royal palace; You are an eagle, make your nest on the cliffs of mountains.
Explanation: Iqbal uses the "Shaheen" (Eagle) as a metaphor for the ideal Muslim youth. The eagle symbolizes courage, high ambition, freedom from material possessions, and a far-reaching vision. It does not build a comfortable nest but lives in the harsh, high mountains, signifying a life of struggle and high ideals, not one of comfort and luxury.

(Message to the Youth)
Mohabbat mujhe un jawanon se hai
Sitaron pe jo dalte hain kamand.
English Translation: I have love for those youths who cast their lasso upon the stars.
Explanation: This verse expresses Iqbal's admiration for ambitious and daring young people. He encourages the youth to aim for the impossible, to be pioneers, and to strive for greatness beyond the ordinary limits. The "stars" represent lofty goals and aspirations.
